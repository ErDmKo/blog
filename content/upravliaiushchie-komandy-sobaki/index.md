## Rei General info

### About üêï
3.5 years old
shiba inu
sterilized, chipped, has all necessary vaccinations
has international passport
taxpayer

### Walks üèû
twice a day - one in the morning and one in the evening
she ll be very happy with any additional walks, but that's not necessary

morning she usually walks around 8-9 and in the evening around 18-19
but she is quite flexible about those timings
sometimes on weekends we walk with her like 10 or 11 in the morning and she is ok with it
in case it's an emergency - she usually let us know by crying, running around and leading owards the door

Most of the time we walk with her about 20 minutes - waiting for her to do both her businesses
But she is ok with long walks as well if e.g. you wanna take her with you somewhere.
The only thing about long walks is that she might want to drink
We sometimes take with us some water for her or if we walk around the lake - she can just drink from there

### Food üçó
she really loves food 
she eats twice a day after her walks
we put her a little less than half of her bowl [like on picture]

{{< imgresize "eda.jpg" "Some food" >}} 

she also needs to have her water bowl at least half full, so she always has enough when she needs
we give her cold tap water

### Additional food üòã
that's absolutely not necessary but she will be there every time you eat
so we give here no more than 2-3 of her chicken treats per day
and a little bit of kefir/yogurt [like on picture]

{{< imgresize "edk_ygurt.jpg" "yogurt" >}} 

and also if something falls when we cook - that's hers - so if something falls that should not be eaten - you should be quick
she usually understands "no" or "don't touch it" ("net / nel'zya" or "fuuu" in Russian) but not always üôÅ please, be careful about that

if you can you don't need to give her anything additional - it's even better
but if you can't resist her (because she is going to ask look you in the eye and ask) - you can give her little pieces of meat/chicken, some small pieces of fruits or vegetables like apples, carrots, cucumbers, kefir or yogurt

anything else better not to give - especially NO for tomatoes, onions, cabbage, bread and sweats

### Playtime üéÆ
that's her second favorite after food
but it's only if you have time or mood for this
she can live without it and she can also play on her own

her top 3 games are:
- chase me and get my toy (or just chase me)
- get the toy out of my mouth while i'm being a scary dog
- throw me something and maybe i'll bring it back to you

she also loves dog ball - it's the game with a ball and any other toy, when she chases the ball with her paws and having any other toy in her mouth

### Character üë©‚Äçüé§
she is a big fat drama queen
some of her reactions seem like she's dying or something - usually it's ok and no problem

she could bark at the door if there're some if someone is at it
very sorry about that
you could strictly ask her not to do it like "net" or "Rei, nel'zya"
but that doesn't help all the time 
so if it's really bad you can give her some treats or attract her attention to something else like a game 

we're allowing her almost everywhere - like in bed or on the sofa.
but she usually listens if you forbid that 
maybe she would need several times to understand, but finally she listents

she doesn't eat anything from the table without clear permission and she doesn't chew anything except for her toys - so there's absolutely no problem with that
but if you've given her something and she feels like it's hers - she guards it really hard and might even be quite aggressive
so just in case be careful

and all in all she is very shy
she is scared of birds, and scared of water, scared of many new things

she is not the biggest fan of being pet
but she allows this from time to time - when she is relaxed like after a good sleep, or when she is very happy
sometimes she comes to you on her own, lies next to you and asks to scratch her belly - but that's not often

she is not a fan of being washed
in case she becomes overdrammatic (she is drama queen after all) about that - we usually just use a wet towel to clean her so not to bring her to the bathtub
 
she is very well reacting to phrases like "you're bad dog" or sounds of being scared like üôÄ
so this can be used to stop either her bad behavior, or drammatism, or aggressiveness

most of the times she just sleeps on the floor - somewhere where it's calder
but she can also come to sleep with you in your bad - you can ask her not to do that!!

### Other dogs üê©üêï‚Äçü¶∫ü¶Æ
she can be aggressive with other dog
she could growl at them or sometimes she could lie down and wait for them to attack
she doesn't mean anything bad by that - that's her strange personal style to invite them to play
but most owners are scared of such a behavior so we just try to keep our distance when walking

we're keeping her on the leash most of times
only when there's really no-one around or if we're sure that other dogs' owners don't mind

in case you'll have a walk like in the wood or some other places with long grass  - please check if she doesn't catch any ticks
when it's in the city - that's absolutely not necessary, we don't do that

### Health and if something happens üíä
if she pukes 1-2 times  - that happens, don't worry about that
sometimes she eats something like sticks or cones and they're coming out

in case she eats something really suspicious or you're worried about her,
you can give her like 6-7 pills of "activirovanniy ugol" [we'll give you that]
her poop is gonna be black after that but that's ok

usually if she eats and plays and is active - she is ok even if she pukes –µ—Å–ª–∏ –µ—Å—Ç, –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç - –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç –Ω–µ –≤—Å–µ —Ç–∞–∫ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—à–Ω–æ
it's quite different if she feels unwell

in the beginning when we leave her she might become sad or nervous, 
she could not eat much or sometimes lie down very sad, or not sleep well
that's ok 
she'll get used to you and be happy
and she'll be active anyway, just nervous

if something really bad happens - please take her and her passport to the vet
we'll of cause cover all the bills or anything she needs

### In conclusion ü•≥
Anyway - she is a great dog!
She is always happy when you come back home!
She loves complements and loves to be around people!
She is very cute and we hope that you would enjoy the time with her!
