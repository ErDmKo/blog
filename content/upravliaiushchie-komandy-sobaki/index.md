## Rei General info

### About 🐕
3.5 years old shiba inu,
sterilized,
chipped,
has all necessary vaccinations,
owner of european passport,
responsible taxpayer

### Walks 🏞
twice a day: first time in the morning and second time in the evening. She’ll be very happy with any additional walks, but that’s not necessary.

In the morning she usually walks around 8-9 and in the evening around 18-19. But she is quite flexible about the timings. Sometimes on the weekends we walk her around 10 or 11 in the morning, and she is ok with that. She is not a morning dog. In case of an emergency, she will usually let you know by wining, screaming, running around and leading you to the door.

Most of the time we walk with her about 20 minutes. That’s how long it takes to find her sweet spot to do both her businesses. But she is ok with long walks as well, in case you’d like to take her with you somewhere. The only thing about long walks is that she might want to drink. We take some water with us for her, or when we walk around the lake or river, she can just drink from there.

### Food 🍗
She loves food. Twice a day after her walks she has her two big meals. We put her a little less than half of her bowl [like on picture]

{{< imgresize "eda.jpg" "Some food" >}} 

She also needs to have her water bowl at least half full, so she always has enough when she needs. We give her cold tap water.

### Additional food 😋
That is absolutely unnecessary, but keep in mind that she will be there every time you eat. So you kinda have to give her something else. We try to give her no more than 2-3 of her chicken treats per day and a little bit of kefir/yogurt [like on picture]

{{< imgresize "edk_ygurt.jpg" "yogurt" >}} 

And also if something falls when we cook - that’s hers. So if something falls that you don’t want her to eat - be quick. She usually understands “no” or “don’t touch it” (“net / nel’zya” or “fuuu” in Russian) but not always 🙁 So please, be careful about that.

If you can resist, you don’t need to give her anything additional (because she is going to look you in the eye and beg). You can give her little pieces of meat/chicken, some small pieces of fruits or vegetables like apples, carrots, cucumbers, kefir or yogurt.

Anything else better not to give - especially NO tomatoes, onions, cabbage, bread and sweats.

### Playtime 🎮
That is her second favorite after food. But it’s only if you have time or mood for this. She can live without it, and she can also play on her own

top 3 games are:
 - chase me and get my toy (or just chase me)
 - get the toy out of my mouth while i’m being a scary dog
 - throw me something and maybe i’ll bring it back to you

she also loves dog ball. Dogball is the game with a ball and any other toy. She chases the ball with her paws while carrying any other toy in her mouth.

### Character 👩‍🎤
Rei is a big fat drama queen. Some of her reactions seem like she’s dying, but for the most of time it’s ok and no problem.

She could bark at the door if someone is there. We’re very sorry about that. You could strictly ask her not to do it like “net” or “Rei, nel’zya”. But that doesn’t help all the time. So if it’s really bad, you can give her treats or switch her attention to something else like a game. 

We allow her almost everywhere - like in bed or on the sofa. But she usually listens if you forbid that. Maybe you’d need to forbid it several times for her to understand, but finally she listens.

She doesn’t eat anything from the table without clear permission, and she doesn’t chew anything except for her toys. So there’s absolutely no problem with that. But when you’ve given her something, and she feels it’s hers now - she guards it really hard with all her doggy soul and might even get very aggressive. So just in case be careful, and let her be.

All in all she is very shy. Rei is scared of birds, and of water, scared of many new things.

She is not the biggest fan of being pet, but she allows this from time to time. When she is relaxed like after a good sleep, or when she is very happy, she comes to you on her own, lies next to you and asks to scratch her belly. But this doesn’t happen very often.

She is not a fan of being washed. Washing always triggers a lot of drama (she is drama queen after all). So when it’s really bad and can’t be ignored, we just use a wet towel to clean her, not to bring her to the bathtub.

she reacts to phrases like “you’re bad dog” or sounds of being scared like “aaah”🙀 very well. And this can be used to stop either her bad behavior, or drammatism, or aggressiveness.

Most of the time she just sleeps on the floor - somewhere where it’s colder. But she can also come to sleep with you in your bad - you can ask her not to do that!!


### Other dogs 🐩🐕‍🦺🦮
She can be aggressive with other dogs. She could growl at them or sometimes she could lie down and wait for them to attack. She doesn’t mean anything bad by that like killing - that’s her strange personal style to invite them to play. 

However, most owners are scared of such a behavior.And we just try to keep our distance when walking. 

We keep her on the leash most of times. Only when there’s really no-one around or if we’re sure that other dogs’ owners don’t mind - we let her go. 

In case you’ll have a walk like in the woods or some other places with long grass - please check if she doesn’t catch any ticks.


### Health and if something happens 💊
if she pukes 1-2 times - that happens, don’t worry about that if she behaves normally after. Sometimes she eats something like sticks or cones and they’re coming out.

In case she eats something really suspicious or you’re worried about her, you can give her like 6-7 pills of “activirovanniy ugol” [we’ll give you that]. Her poop is gonna be black after that but that’s ok.

Usually when she eats and plays and is active - she is ok even if she pukes. It’s quite different when she feels unwell - you’ll see the difference.

At first when we leave her, she might become sad or nervous, she could not eat much or sometimes lie down very sad, or not sleep. Well - that’s ok. She’ll get used to you in a while and be happy. And she’ll be active anyway, just nervous.

If something really bad happens - please take her and her passport to the vet. We’ll of cause cover all the bills or anything she needs.


### In conclusion 🥳
Anyway - she is a great dog! 
She is always happy when you come back home! 
She loves complements and loves to be around people!
She is very cute and we hope that you would enjoy all the time with her!
